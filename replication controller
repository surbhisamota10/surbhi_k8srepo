Command

Create a replication controller yaml file from this site https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/
vi replication.yaml

    apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

  

kubectl apply -f replication.yaml

The output is similar to this if you create rc from above website 
replicationcontroller/nginx created

check status of replicationcontroller
kubectl describe replicationcontrollers/nginx

using below command we delete both replicationcontroller and pods
kubectl delete rc replicationcontroller_name

using below command we only delete rreplicationcontroller not pods
kubectl delete  --cascade=orphan replicationcontroller_name

kubectl rolling-update command is depricated now


If we have any pod with label  app: nginx then rc acquire this pod
